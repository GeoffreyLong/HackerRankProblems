ALL TEST CASES PASSED


Sample Challenge 
This is a simple challenge to get things started. Given a sorted array (ar) and a number (V), can you print the index location of V in the array?

{The next section describes the input format. You can often skip it if you are using included methods. }

Input Format
There will be three lines of input:

V - the value you are looking for.
n - the size of the array.
ar - n numbers that makes up the array.
Output Format
Output the index of V in the array.

{The next section describes the constraints and ranges of the input. Occasionally you want to check here to see how big the input could be. }

Constraints
1<=n<=1000 
-1000 <=x <= 1000 , x ∈ ar

{This “sample” shows the first input case. It is often useful to skip to the sample to understand a challenge. }

Sample Input

4
6
1 4 5 7 9 12
Sample Output

1
Explanation
V = 4. The 4 is located in the 1th spot on the array, so the answer is 1.
